# Motivation

The origin of the project is the desire for an easily accessible place for data
exchange on the Internet.  
Inspired by JSON-Storages the idea of a feature-rich equivalent based on XML,
XPath and XSLT was born.  
The focus should be on a public, volatile and short-term data exchange for
(static) web applications and IoT.

__Just exchange data without a own server landscape.__  
__Just exchange data without knowing and managing all clients.__
