# Motivation

The origin of the project is the desire for an easily accessible place for data
exchange on the Internet. Inspired by JSON-Storages the idea of a feature-rich
equivalent based on XML, XPath and XSLT was born. The focus should be on a
public, volatile and short-term data exchange for (static) web applications and
IoT.

__Just exchange data without a own server landscape.__  
__Just exchange data without knowing and managing all clients.__
