  CR: Service: Added optional ACME challenge function
      e.g. for Cerbot and Let's Encrypt

      this option additionally opens port 80 only exclusive for the challenge.
  CR: Service: Added the support of the XSLT processor as a subdirectory of the application directory
          supports: ./libxml ./libxml2
      In these cases, no configuration is required from the XSLT processor.
  CR: Service: Added support of system environment variable LIBXML_HOME, LIBXML2_HOME or XSLTPROC_HOME
      Can optionally be used as an alternative for the extension of the path variable.
      LIBXML_HOME/LIBXML2_HOME/XSLTPROC_HOME is the bin directory of libxml2/xsltproc.
  CR: Service: Check of the availability of the XSLT process with the start of the service
      If the XSLT processor is not available, the service ends with an error output.
