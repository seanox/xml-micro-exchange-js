    <h1>Seanox XMEX - XML-Micro-Exchange (Free Web Service)</h1>
    <p>
      The origin of the project is the desire for an easily accessible place
      for data exchange on the Internet.Inspired by JSON-Storages the idea of a
      feature-rich equivalent based on XML, XPath and XSLT was born. The focus
      should be on a public, volatile and short-term data exchange for (static)
      web-applications and IoT.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Just exchange data without an own server landscape.<br>
        Just exchange data without knowing and managing all clients.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      XML-Micro-Exchange is a RESTful volatile NoSQL stateless micro datasource
      for the Internet. It is designed for easy communication and data exchange
      of web-applications and for IoT or for other Internet-based modules and
      components. The XML based datasource is volatile and lives through
      continuous use and expires through inactivity. They are designed for
      active and near real-time data exchange but not as a real-time capable
      long-term storage. Compared to a JSON storage, this datasource supports
      more dynamics, partial data access, data transformation, and volatile
      short-term storage.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why all this?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Static web-applications on different clients want to communicate with
      each other, e.g. for games, chats and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smart sensors want to share their data and smart devices want to access
      this data and also exchange data with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clients can establish dynamically volatile networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        In this communication are all participants.<br>
        No one is a server or master, all are equal and no one has to know the other.<br>
        All meet without obligation.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <strong>RESTful</strong><br>
    <p>The REST API supports the HTTP methods OPTIONS, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.</p>
    <strong>XPath</strong><br>
    <p>XPath axes and functions are used for access, navigation and addressing of targets in the data source and it is an integral part of the URI with dynamic and functional effects.</p>
    <strong>Multible axes and targets</strong><br>
    <p>An XPath axis can address several elements and attributes simultaneously, which can be changed with one call.</p>
    <strong>XPath Functions</strong><br>
    <p>PUT and PATCH support XML structures and static values (text), as well as XPath functions that allow dynamic values.</p>
    <strong>Data Query</strong><br>
    <p>Data can be queried in the form of XML structure or substructure if the XPath notation represents an axis, otherwise the XPath is interpreted as an XPath function and responded with the result as text. Thus XPath provides a dynamic syntax for queries.</p>
    <strong>Data Transformation</strong><br>
    <p>The POST method supports data transformation via XSLT. Similar to GET, data can be queried and then transformed with an XSLT template transmitted via POST.</p>
    <strong>JSON Support</strong><br>
    <p>All requests can be responded by the service in JSON format.</p>
    <strong>Security</strong><br>
    <p>This aspect was deliberately considered and implemented here only in a very rudimentary form. The storage(-key) with a length of 1 - 64 characters and the individual root element can be regarded as secret. In addition, HTTPS is supported but without client certificate authorization.</p>

    <h3>API</h3>
    <p>
      HTTP is used. The URI typically contains a noticeable separator to divide
      it into context path and XPath. For the API only the XPath is relevant.
    </p>
    <pre>
https://xmex.seanox.com/xmex!xpath(-function)
<-------------------------->|<-------------->
        Context Path              XPath
    </pre>
    <p>
      In some cases, the XPath syntax may not be supported as a URI by the
      client or provider. In these cases, the XPath can alternatively be used
      as a query string or hexadecimal or Base64 encoded.

      The request supports the following additional headers:
    </p>
    <pre>
Storage                    Storage identifier optional with name of the root element
Accept-Effects             Controls the content of Storage Effects header
    </pre>
    <p>
      Also the reponse has additional headers:
    </p>
    <pre>
Connection-Unique          Unique ID created by the API to mark client owner data
Storage                    Storage identifier without the name of the root element
Storage-Revision           Current revision of the storage
Storage-Space              Capacity of the storage (total/used in bytes)
Storage-Last-Modified      Timestamp (RFC822) of the last access
Storage-Expiration         Timestamp (RFC822) when the storage will expire
Storage-Expiration-Time    Idle time in milliseconds until storage expires
Storage-Effects            For PUT/PATCH/DELETE, UUIDs directly affected by the request
Execution-Time             Duration of request processing in milliseconds
Error                      Unique error number from the logging with status 500
Message                    Detailed error message with status 400 / 422
    </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Notice about response code 404: This always refers to the storage, but never
        to an addressed target in the storage.<br>
        If a target does not exist, requests are responded to with code 204.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The storage must be opened by OPTIONS.<br>
          This can be done by any client, even if the storage already exists.
          The response then contains the header <code>Connection-Unique</code>.
          This is unique across all storages and can be used by the client to
          identify its own data in the storage. But this is optional and
          <code>Connection-Unique</code> is neither assigned to the client nor
          to the connection, it is just a unique value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The client should always proceed as if it were using storage alone
          and created the schema it needs.<br>
          The creation of the schema is done with PUT. Relative and conditional
          axes should be used as targets. This ensures that no duplicates are
          created or data is overwritten.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          e.g. <code>PUT /books[not(book[@title='A Modern Utopia'])]::last</code><br>
          This approach made transactions unnecessary.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now the client can use the storage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Closing or terminating the storage is not possible and required.<br>
          The storage expires automatically due to inactivity. The duration of
          use and expiration time of the storage is contained in the response
          in the headers <code>Storage-Last-Modified</code>,
          <code>Storage-Expiration</code>, <code>Storage-Expiration-Time</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

      <strong>Please do not get confused, the API is online.<br>
      Requests without storage identifier are responded with status 400.</strong>

    <p>
      It is a small server (1 Core, 512 MB, 10 GB SSD) in a big datacenter --
      but apparently enough.<br>
      <strong>Sponsors are always welcome.</strong><br>
      The project needs <del>a good and simple domain and</del> if possible more power.<br>
      It costs about 5 Euro per month for 65536 x 1024 kB with double CPU cores
      and double memory.
