    <h1>Seanox XMEX - XML-Micro-Exchange (Free Web Service)</h1>
    <p>The origin of the project is the desire for an easily accessible place for data
      exchange on the Internet.<br>
      Inspired by JSON-Storages the idea of a feature-rich equivalent based on XML,
      XPath and XSLT was born.<br>
      The focus should be on a public, volatile and short-term data exchange for
      (static) web-applications and IoT.</p>
    <p><strong>Just exchange data without an own server landscape.</strong><br>
      <strong>Just exchange data without knowing and managing all clients.</strong></p>
    <p>XML-Micro-Exchange is a RESTful volatile NoSQL stateless micro datasource for
      the Internet. It is designed for easy communication and data exchange of
      web-applications and for IoT or for other Internet-based modules and
      components.<br>
      The XML based datasource is volatile and lives through continuous use and
      expires through inactivity. They are designed for active and near real-time data
      exchange but not as a real-time capable long-term storage.<br>
      Compared to a JSON storage, this datasource supports more dynamics, partial data
      access, data transformation, and volatile short-term storage.</p>
    <p><strong>Why all this?</strong></p>
    <p>Static web-applications on different clients want to communicate with each
      other, e.g. for games, chats and collaboration.</p>
    <p>Smart sensors want to share their data and smart devices want to access this
      data and also exchange data with each other.</p>
    <p>Clients can establish dynamically volatile networks.</p>
    <p><strong>In this communication are all participants.</strong><br>
      <strong>No one is a server or master, all are equal and no one has to know the other.</strong><br>
      <strong>All meet without obligation.</strong></p>
