    <h1>Seanox XMEX - XML-Micro-Exchange (Free Web Service)</h1>
    <p>The origin of the project is the desire for an easily accessible place for data
      exchange on the Internet.<br>
      Inspired by JSON-Storages the idea of a feature-rich equivalent based on XML,
      XPath and XSLT was born.<br>
      The focus should be on a public, volatile and short-term data exchange for
      (static) web-applications and IoT.</p>
    <p><strong>Just exchange data without an own server landscape.</strong><br>
      <strong>Just exchange data without knowing and managing all clients.</strong></p>
    <p>XML-Micro-Exchange is a RESTful volatile NoSQL stateless micro datasource for
      the Internet. It is designed for easy communication and data exchange of
      web-applications and for IoT or for other Internet-based modules and
      components.<br>
      The XML based datasource is volatile and lives through continuous use and
      expires through inactivity. They are designed for active and near real-time data
      exchange but not as a real-time capable long-term storage.<br>
      Compared to a JSON storage, this datasource supports more dynamics, partial data
      access, data transformation, and volatile short-term storage.</p>
    <p><strong>Why all this?</strong></p>
    <p>Static web-applications on different clients want to communicate with each
      other, e.g. for games, chats and collaboration.</p>
    <p>Smart sensors want to share their data and smart devices want to access this
      data and also exchange data with each other.</p>
    <p>Clients can establish dynamically volatile networks.</p>
    <p><strong>In this communication are all participants.</strong><br>
      <strong>No one is a server or master, all are equal and no one has to know the other.</strong><br>
      <strong>All meet without obligation.</strong></p>

    <h3>API</h3>
    <p>
      HTTP is used. The URI typically contains a noticeable separator to divide
      it into context path and XPath. For the API only the XPath is relevant.
    </p>
    <pre>
https://xmex.seanox.com/xmex!xpath(-function)
<-------------------------->|<-------------->
        Context Path              XPath
    </pre>
    <p>
      In some cases, the XPath syntax may not be supported as a URI by the
      client or provider. In these cases, the XPath can alternatively be used
      as a query string or hexadecimal or Base64 encoded.

    <p>
      The request supports the following additional headers:
    </p>
    <pre>
Storage                    Storage identifier optional with name of the root element
Accept-Effects             Controls the content of Storage Effects header
    </pre>
    <p>
      Also the reponse has additional headers:
    </p>
    <pre>
Connection-Unique          Unique ID created by the API to mark client owner data
Storage                    Storage identifier without the name of the root element
Storage-Revision           Current revision of the storage
Storage-Space              Capacity of the storage (total/used in bytes)
Storage-Last-Modified      Timestamp (RFC822) of the last access
Storage-Expiration         Timestamp (RFC822) when the storage will expire
Storage-Expiration-Time    Idle time in milliseconds until storage expires
Storage-Effects            For PUT/PATCH/DELETE, UUIDs directly affected by the request
Execution-Time             Duration of request processing in milliseconds
Error                      Unique error number from the logging with status 500
Message                    Detailed error message with status 400 / 422
    </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Notice about response code 404: This always refers to the storage, but never
        to an addressed target in the storage.<br>
        If a target does not exist, requests are responded to with code 204.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The storage must be opened by OPTIONS.<br>
          This can be done by any client, even if the storage already exists. The
          response then contains the header <code>Connection-Unique</code>. This is unique
          across all storages and can be used by the client to identify its own data
          in the storage. But this is optional and <code>Connection-Unique</code> is neither
          assigned to the client nor to the connection, it is just a unique value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The client should always proceed as if it were using storage alone and
          created the schema it needs.<br>
          The creation of the schema is done with PUT. Relative and conditional axes
          should be used as targets. This ensures that no duplicates are created or
          data is overwritten.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          e.g. <code>PUT /books[not(book[@title='A Modern Utopia'])]::last</code><br>
          This approach made transactions unnecessary.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now the client can use the storage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Closing or terminating the storage is not possible and required.<br>
          The storage expires automatically due to inactivity. The duration of use
          and expiration time of the storage is contained in the response in the
          headers <code>Storage-Last-Modified</code>, <code>Storage-Expiration</code>,
          <code>Storage-Expiration-Time</code>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

      65536 Storages x 64 kB<br>
      <strong>Please do not get confused, the API is online.<br>
      Requests without storage identifier are responded with status 400.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a small server (1 Core, 512 MB, 10 GB SSD) in a big datacenter -- but apparently enough.<br>
      <strong>Sponsors are always welcome.</strong><br>
      The project needs <del>a good and simple domain</del> and if possible more power.<br>
      It costs about 5 Euro per month for 65536 x 1024 kB with double CPU cores
      and double memory.
